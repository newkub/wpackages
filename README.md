 # wpackages

## Introduction

`wpackages` is a comprehensive monorepo built with Bun and TypeScript, managed by Turborepo. It serves as a centralized hub for developing and maintaining a collection of reusable packages, services, applications, CLI tools, and utilities. The primary goal is to foster code sharing, maintain consistency, and accelerate development across multiple related projects within a single, unified codebase.

## Features

-   ⚡️ **High-Performance Tooling**: Utilizes **Bun** as the package manager and runtime for exceptional speed.
-   🚀 **Optimized Task Running**: Employs **Turborepo** to orchestrate and cache tasks, speeding up builds, tests, and linting.
-   🏗️ **Structured Workspace**: Organizes code logically into distinct workspaces like `packages`, `services`, `apps`, `utils`, and more.
-   ✅ **Automated Quality Checks**: Integrates **Oxlint** for linting and **dprint** for code formatting to ensure code consistency.
-   🧪 **Robust Testing**: Uses **Vitest** for running unit and integration tests within each workspace.
-   훅 **Git Hooks**: Leverages **Lefthook** to automate checks like formatting and linting before commits and pushes.
-   🧩 **Shared Configurations**: Centralizes configurations like `tsconfig.json` to maintain consistency across the entire monorepo.

## Goal

-   🎯 **Centralized Development**: Provide a single workspace to develop and share internal libraries (`packages/*`, `services/*`, `utils/*`, `framework/*`, `lib/*`).
-   🔄 **Consistent Tooling**: Keep tooling and conventions consistent across many small projects.
-   ⏩ **Rapid Iteration**: Enable fast iteration with optimized task pipelines (`format` -> `lint` -> `test` -> `build` -> `verify`).

## Design Principles

-   🏛️ **Monorepo First**: Workspaces are versioned and developed together as a cohesive unit.
-   🤖 **Automation**: Prefer `turbo` tasks over running tools manually to ensure reliability and speed.
-   📏 **Consistency**: Maintain uniform `tsconfig.json` and script conventions across all packages.
-   🔒 **Safety**: Utilize Git hooks to run formatting before commits and verification checks before pushes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   `bun` (This repository uses `bun@1.3.5`)
-   `git`

### Steps

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/newkub/wpackages.git
    cd wpackages
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  Install Git hooks:
    ```bash
    bun run prepare
    ```

## Usage

### Root Commands

Common commands to run from the repository root:

```bash
# Format all code
bun run format

# Lint all workspaces
bun run lint

# Run tests across all workspaces
bun run test

# Build all packages and apps
bun run build

# Run all verification steps (format, lint, test)
bun run verify

# Start development mode for all apps
bun run dev
```

### Workspace-Specific Commands

To run a command for a specific workspace, use the `--filter` flag with Turborepo. The package name is defined in its `package.json`.

## Examples

```bash
# Build only the 'program' app
turbo build --filter=@wpackages/program

# Run tests for the 'palse' library
turbo test --filter=@wpackages/palse

# Lint the 'cache' service
turbo lint --filter=@wpackages/cache
```
